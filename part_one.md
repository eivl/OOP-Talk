# Part one, the object-oriented umbrella.
Object oriented programming has many "hype" words, _**object-oriented analysis**_, _**object-oriented design**_, _**object-oriented programming**_. These are all concept that falls under the same umbrella of object orientation. Normally in software development, design is considered a step you do before programming starts; this isn't true here. Analysis, design and programming tend to overlap, interweave and combine.

## The steps

### Object-oriented analysis (OOA)
Look at problem/task/system and identify the objects and the interactions between those objects. _What_ needs to be done!
Output: a set of requirements

### Object-oriented design (OOD)
Convert the requirements into an implementation specification. You name the objects, define behaviours and formally specify which objects activate behaviour in other objects. _How_ things should be done.
Output: implementation specification

### Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Convert the specification into a working application. 

This process is iterative, and there is no way in real life that you will go from one stage, to the next and end with something finished. 

Now with some definition in place, let us continue with objects and classes.
